JW questions as of 6pm Tues 9/8:

1. Why error on the return function in line 95?

2. How to store data for move counter? I feel like I need to just discuss this concept with you on the call tomorrow

3. How to get winning/draw msg to display when condition is met? Do you have to put some kind of placeholder in the CSS or can this all be done in JS?
